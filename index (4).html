        Hello! I see that you’ve found my page and for that I thank you. Let me dive in real quick about myself and my experiences. Currently I am a graduate from the University of California Riverside, having majored in Sociology and Administrative Studies. There I focused heavily on my schooling to get into a good law school to end up where I am today. During my time as an undergraduate I focused to get as much experience as I could to better my chances and to of course learn how the field works. I was a coordinator, specifically the Student Worker Affairs coordinator for the Labor Relations committee where I focused on bringing issues brought to me by the campus student workers to light. There I worked alongside the rest of the board to speak out and find ways to fix the problems so that all could be well. I was also a Delegate for the Student Voice Commitee. There I would work with the rest of the delegates with the board to bring issues by the general student population to light. From issues that revolved around the food options on campus to issues around professors telling students to purchase 3rd party applications that not may be used often and only wastes the students money. <br><br>

        Both of these positions in particular allowed me to further become one with the University, and be able to meet great people which would be a great asset in having to network in the future outside of campus. I was also an Intern for the Senate at the school, there it was nice to see how the core government of the school worked. How each committee and each department had a say and voice within the senate and were able to express issues there. It was all connected and its where I was able to have my interest further explored. This allowed me to further my focus and my work into my studies, jobs, and part in the student government as it all focused on what I liked and I was able to do what I enjoyed often. Towards the later end of my years of my time being an undergraduate, I focused more on external work. Yes I’ve got my fair share of experience however all of that remained within campus and I wanted to reach out and do more. That is when I began reaching out to firms trying to get a position or an internship if possible. And of course with patience I was able to secure a position that allowed me to work in the real word per say. No longer was I stuck in the campus but I was actively taking part in the society and making changes even if it only was to a few people in the world. All of it allowed me to continue my passion for law and allowed me to get into the law school I’ve been looking over after a while, that being the top law schools of america.
